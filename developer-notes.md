# Developer Notes

This demo was built in React. I have used Redux for app global storage and utilised local state in components where appropriate. I have shown use of a componentised approach with Storybook. I have written tests in Jest.

The app is not accurate to the design as I prioritised some functional aspects. I have also descoped some items such as the Primary navigation, and the graph and definition list.
